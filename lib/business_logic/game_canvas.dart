/*
This is an important class that represents a level in the game.
it contains the number of x points and y points.
it contains the number of movesLeft 
it also contains the following methods

createPoints() : creates the points for the level and fills the allPoints map
calculateMovesLeft() : calculates the number of moves left in the game
decrementMovesLeft() : decrements the number of moves left
